# Project context — Birmingham Ozzy

## What this is
**Ozzy** — an AI-powered data voice for Birmingham City Council. A chat-first interface that reads every public dataset about the city and synthesises direct, opinionated commentary. Six data visualisation views sit behind Ozzy as the evidence locker.

Named after Ozzy Osbourne — working class, blunt, globally Brummie, not what the establishment expected.

Audience: council policy officers and analysts. Also WMCA board presentations.

## Visual direction (signed off — preserve)
- **Editorial paper aesthetic.** Warm paper background (`#f5f3ee`), serif headlines (Instrument Serif), monospace data (IBM Plex Mono), no rounded corners anywhere.
- **ASCII flourishes** as Birmingham brand nods: ASCII bull in empty states, ASCII banner on loader, "FORWARD" (Birmingham motto) watermark, ASCII spinners (`⠋⠙⠹⠸`) during loading.
- **Quadrant colours** (used only on the Economic Matrix): green `#1a3a2a` / purple `#2a1a3a` / blue `#1a2a3a` / red `#3a1a1a`.
- **10-step ink ramp** for disadvantage intensity on grid/map: `#7a8270 → #3a1a1a`.

## Data integrity (hard rule — overrides everything)
- **Official sources only.** A value may render in the UI only if it is traceable to a named source for that exact ward/period. No exceptions for "it looks plausible."
- **Never fabricate, model, synthesise, extrapolate, or hash-generate** a data value that is presented as fact. Do not invent figures to fill gaps, smooth trends, or make a chart look complete.
- **Missing data stays missing.** If a real value can't be sourced, render an explicit "no data" / "—" state and keep the ward/field blank. Never substitute an estimate.
- **Derived values are allowed only if** they are computed transparently from official inputs (e.g. a rank or composite of real figures), are labelled as derived/calculated, and add no new external information. A composite of modelled inputs is itself modelled — not allowed.
- **Provenance is mandatory.** Every rendered metric must carry its source and as-of date in the status drawer / detail panel.

### How that works in practice
- **Live where possible** — NOMIS, IMD 2025 / GVA / Census via City Observatory, ONS ward boundaries are public, keyed by official ONS ward code (`E05011118–E05011186`). Never join on the legacy `FALLBACK` codes in `lib/data.ts` — they are a wrong vintage.
- **Fallbacks must themselves be real.** A live fetch may fall back to a committed snapshot **only if that snapshot is real sourced data** (e.g. `lib/education-data.ts` Census 2021, `public/data/crime-wards.json` from data.police.uk). A fallback must never be a synthesised stand-in.
- **Status drawer** in the header shows live/cached state + as-of date per source — must stay visible the whole session.
- **Legacy modelled code is being removed.** `lib/synth*.ts`, `extras()`, `buildHousingWards`, `buildFiscalWards`, and `computeNeetRisk` all produce modelled values — they must be re-sourced from real data or pulled from the UI, not shipped.

## Hard rules
- Never put API keys in browser-shipped code. Keyed APIs (DWP Stat-Xplore, ONS API+) must go through server-side API routes / edge functions.
- No synthesised/modelled values in the UI — see **Data integrity** above. Missing data renders as "—", never as an estimate.
- Mobile: full responsive, but desktop is the primary target.
- Print: landscape A4, ranked table view only (currently).

## Brand
- Birmingham City Council. Motto is "Forward" — already used as a watermark.
- A subtle BCC red badge sits in the header. Don't add a full BCC logo — the design predates the council's brand refresh and is intentionally neutral.

## Stack hints
If porting to a framework, recommendation is Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind. Chart.js and Leaflet should stay — they're tuned. See `README.md` in `design_handoff_birmingham_dashboard/` for the full porting plan.
